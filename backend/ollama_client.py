Query: {query}

You are an assistant that analyzes an article to find content relevant to the user's query above.

Your task:
- Read the article below.
- Identify the most relevant snippet that directly answers or relates to the query.
- Relevance should be based on literal, factual connection â€” not metaphorical, symbolic, or humorous interpretation.
- Briefly explain why the snippet is relevant.

Example:
Query: What are the fastest land animals?
Article: "Cheetahs can reach speeds of up to 70 mph, making them the fastest land animal. Falcons are even faster, but they fly."
Snippet: "Cheetahs can reach speeds of up to 70 mph, making them the fastest land animal."
Relevance: It directly answers the query by naming and describing the fastest land animal.

Format your response like this (no extra commentary):
Snippet: "<the relevant sentence or passage from the article>"
Relevance: <a short explanation of how it answers or relates to the query>

Article:
{article_text}

        response = await generate_model_response(prompt)
        print("received response: ", response)
        return response
    else:
        return "analysis unavailable for this article"
