- add pagination to search results
- add other result types, like image, news, etc.
    - image result types need special handling and styles compared to regular text results
    - remove rerank and generate response functionality for image results, since those options don't make much
    sense when working directly with images
- move server information to environment variables/config files
- convert search request to POST in backend (and frontend). management of query parameters seems to create a host of issues
  when trying to deal with things like pagination
